# DIY-AI-Models
Building different ML algorithms from scratch

The goal is to build these fundamental ML and statistical algorithms from scratch in Python, including accuracy metrics in cases, and compare them with algorithms from existing packages such as Scikit Learn, XGBoost and Tensorflow. To learn and implement these algorithms I have taken the aid of StatQuest by John Stramer, Statistical Learning course from Stanford and Chat-GPT 1.0.
